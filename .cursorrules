# Cursor Rules

## Instructions

Maps & Memories will operate as a simple e-commerce platform without user logins. Customers can browse and purchase products seamlessly, while an admin panel will be available for managing products and orders visible only with a login and password for admin, not users.

- Record fixes for mistakes or corrections to avoid repetition in the `Lessons` section.
- Organize thoughts and plan steps before starting a task in the `Scratchpad` section.
- Clear old tasks if necessary.
- Use todo markers for progress tracking:
  - `[x] ` Completed tasks
  - `[ ]` Pending tasks
- Update Scratchpad after completing subtasks.
- Reflect and plan after milestones for better task management.
- Always refer to Scratchpad before planning the next step.

##

Brand Styling Guide
The e-commerce platform should strictly follow the Maps & Memories brand identity as per the brand guide.
Typography
Web fonts: Use a clean, modern sans-serif font for web content (e.g., Lato, Montserrat)
Color Palette
• White (#F7F5F6) - Background elements
• Dark Blue (#253946) - Main text and headings
• Soft Blue (#95A7B5) - Accents
• Beige (#D2BDA2) - Secondary background
• Warm Brown (#A76825) - Call-to-action buttons
UI Elements
• Minimalist and elegant design
• Subtle borders and spacing to maintain a clean look
• Icons should match the outlined, modern style used in branding
Imagery
• Use high-resolution images with soft shadows
• Consistent lighting for product shots
• Backgrounds should be neutral or lightly textured
Buttons & Links
• Call-to-action buttons (e.g., "Buy Now") should use Warm Brown (#A76825)
• Secondary buttons (e.g., "Learn More") can use Soft Blue (#95A7B5)
• Hover effects should be subtle (light color changes or soft shadows)

## Lessons

1. Use `npx shadcn@latest add [component]` instead of `npx shadcn-ui@latest add [component]` when installing Shadcn UI components.
2. In Next.js 14+, page props params must be typed as a Promise. Example:
   ```typescript
   type tParams = Promise<{ id: string }>;
   interface PageProps {
     params: tParams;
   }
   ```
   Then await the params in the component:
   ```typescript
   export default async function Page(props: PageProps) {
     const { id } = await props.params;
   }
   ```
3. Use `const session = await auth()` instead of `const session = await getServerSession(authOptions)` for Next.js authentication. The new `auth()` function is the recommended way to get the session in Next.js Auth v5.
4. When importing `useRouter` from 'next/navigation', the component must be marked as a client component using the `'use client'` directive at the top of the file, as this hook only works on the client side.
5. Install Shadcn UI components individually using separate commands (`npx shadcn@latest add [component]`) rather than installing multiple components at once to avoid PowerShell console errors and ensure each component is installed correctly with the proper dependencies.
6. Use `bcryptjs` instead of `bcrypt` for password hashing in Next.js projects, as it's more compatible with various environments and doesn't require native bindings.
7. Use CommonJS syntax (`require()`) instead of ES modules (`import`) in Prisma seed files when using ts-node to avoid "Cannot use import statement outside a module" errors.
8. When using Stripe in Next.js client components, use environment variables with the `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix, and ensure proper error handling for cases when the keys might be undefined.
